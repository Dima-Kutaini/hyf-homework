            <p>Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce
            led by weh development include e com merce. Online auction sites
            such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods
            and servic es. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com among
            many others have transformed the shopping and bargain hunting
            expenence fo many consumers</p>

             <h2 class="head-content">PRACTICAL WEB DEVELPOMENT</h2>
             <p>Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a
              growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by
              businesses wishing to use their website to sell products and
              services to customers.</p>
  
            <p>There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB,
                GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack.
                This has kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum.
                Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been
                the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-develop ment software, such as
                Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio.
                Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming
                languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can
                be learned and implemented quickly with the help of help files,
                technical books, internet tutorials or face-to-face training.</p>

                <p>An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers
                    build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers
                    now help to deliver applications as web services which were
                    traditionally only available as applica tions on a desk-based
                    computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to de centralize
                    information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the
                    rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and
                    Google Docs. These web services allow users to interact with
                    applications from many locations, instead of being tied to a
                    specific workstation for their application environment.</p>
