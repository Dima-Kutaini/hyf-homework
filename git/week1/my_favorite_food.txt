Syrian Falafel 
Ingredients

200g dried chickpeas
3 cloves garlic
½ onion, roughly chopped
1 tsp ground cumin
2 tsp ground coriander
¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda
4 tbsp sesame seeds
for deep-frying vegetable oilgit
a sprinkle sumac, to serve (optional)
Method

STEP 1
Put the chickpeas in a bowl and cover with water. Leave to soak overnight, changing the water at least twice, if possible.
STEP 2
Blitz the garlic and onion in a food processor, then add the drained chickpeas and whizz to a fairly smooth paste. Add the spices and mix well, then stir through the bicarbonate of soda and sesame seeds. Season well.
STEP 3
Fill a pan no more than a third full with vegetable oil and heat to 180C or until a cube of bread browns in 30 seconds.
STEP 4
Shape a little of the falafel mixture into an oval shape with a tablespoon, then gently push into the oil using another spoon. Do this with a few more spoonfuls of the mixture. Cook, in batches, for 4 minutes or until deep golden and crisp. Repeat with the remaining mixture. Serve sprinkled with sumac, if you like.
