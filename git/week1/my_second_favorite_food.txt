Grape Leaves Aleppo
Ingredients

1 cup uncooked white rice

2 pounds ground lamb

1 tablespoon ground allspice

1 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon ground black pepper

2 (16 ounce) jars grape leaves, drained and rinsed

6 cloves garlic, sliced

1 cup lemon juice

2 kalamata olives (Optional)
Directions

Soak rice in cold water, and drain. Mix together ground lamb, rice, allspice, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until well blended. Place about 1 tablespoon of the meat mixture onto the center of each grape leaf. Fold leaf over once, turn in the edges on each side, and then roll the leaf closed.

Stack leaf rolls in a large pot, covering each layer with slices of garlic. Add just enough water to cover rolls, then pour in lemon juice. Add olives to the pot for flavoring. Place a plate on top of the rolls to keep them under the water.

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer for 1 hour 15 minutes. Taste rice for doneness. Grape leaves taste even better after sitting for several hours. Serve and enjoy.

Tip
Do not stack the rolled grape leaves more than 3 or 4 layers deep in the pan. More layers can make the rolls cook unevenly; the ones on the bottom may overcook before the ones on the top are done.
